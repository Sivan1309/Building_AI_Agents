This is a really cutting-edge and transformative area.\n\nLet me elaborate on what this entails:\n\n**The Core Idea:**\n\nTraditionally, drug discovery involved a lot of trial-and-error. Scientists would synthesize many molecules, test them in the lab, and see which ones showed promising activity against a disease target. This is a slow, expensive, and often inefficient process.\n\nAI-powered molecule design and optimization flips this on its head. Instead of just searching for existing molecules, AI can *generate* new ones with specific desired characteristics.\n\n**Key Aspects and Techniques:**\n\n1.  **De Novo Drug Design (Generative AI):**\n    *   **What it is:** This is the process of creating entirely new molecular structures that have never been synthesized before. Think of it as AI \"imagining\" new drugs.\n    *   **How it works:** Generative AI models, such as **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** and **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**, are trained on vast datasets of existing drug-like molecules. These models learn the underlying rules and patterns that make a molecule \"drug-like\" – its chemical structure, its common functional groups, its preferred shapes, etc.\n    *   **The Process:**\n        *   **Input:** The researcher typically provides the AI with a target protein structure or desired properties (e.g., high binding affinity to a specific receptor, low predicted toxicity).\n        *   **Generation:** The AI then generates a new molecule or a set of molecules that are predicted to meet these criteria. It essentially \"draws\" or \"builds\" these molecules atom by atom or fragment by fragment.\n        *   **Output:** The AI provides the chemical structure of the novel molecule, which can then be synthesized and tested experimentally.\n\n2.  **Predicting Molecular Properties:**\n    *   **What it is:** Before even generating a molecule, or immediately after, AI can predict how a molecule will behave. This is crucial for filtering out candidates that are unlikely to succeed.\n    *   **Properties Predicted:**\n        *   **Efficacy:** How well will it bind to the target and produce the desired biological effect?\n        *   **Toxicity:** Is it likely to be harmful to cells or the body?\n        *   **Pharmacokinetics (ADME):** How will the body **A**bsorb, **D**istribute, **M**etabolize, and **E**xcrete the drug? This is vital for determining dosage and frequency.\n        *   **Solubility:** Can it be dissolved in a liquid for administration?\n        *   **Stability:** Will it degrade too quickly?\n        *   **Synthesizability:** Can this molecule actually be made in a lab, and if so, how easily?\n    *   **How it works:** Machine learning models (often deep learning) are trained on experimental data of known molecules and their properties. They learn to identify correlations between molecular structure and these properties.\n\n3.  **Optimizing Lead Compounds:**\n    *   **What it is:** Once a promising molecule (a \"lead compound\") is identified, it rarely has perfect properties. Optimization involves making small chemical modifications to improve it.\n    *   **How AI helps:** AI can explore a vast \"chemical space\" around the lead compound, suggesting specific modifications (e.g., adding a methyl group, changing a ring structure) that are predicted to enhance desired properties (like potency or reduce side effects) without compromising others. It can suggest iterative improvements.\n\n**Why is this a \"development\"?**\n\n*   **Moving Beyond Screening:** It shifts the paradigm from finding a needle in a haystack (screening existing libraries) to intelligently designing the needle itself.\n*   **Unprecedented Speed:** AI can explore millions of potential molecular designs in days or weeks, a task that would take years with traditional methods.\n*   **Novelty:** AI can generate molecules with completely new scaffolds and chemical properties, opening up possibilities for tackling diseases that were previously considered \"undruggable.\"\n*   **Efficiency:** By predicting properties early and generating more promising candidates, AI reduces the number of failed experiments and costly late-stage setbacks.\n\n**Companies Leading the Way (as mentioned before, but worth reiterating):**\n\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** Famous for using generative AI to design novel molecules, with several AI-discovered drugs now in clinical trials.\n*   **Exscientia:** Focuses on an end-to-end AI platform for drug design, aiming to accelerate the entire discovery and development process.\n*   **Atomwise:** Utilizes deep learning for virtual screening and then leverages AI for lead optimization.\n\nIn essence, AI-powered molecule design is about using computational intelligence to act as a hyper-intelligent chemist, designing and refining drug candidates with remarkable speed and precision. It's a significant leap forward in our ability to create new medicines.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the companies at the forefront of AI-powered molecule design and optimization.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
