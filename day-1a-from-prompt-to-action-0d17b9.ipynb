An agent can do more than just respond to a prompt — it can **take actions** to find information or get things done.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll:\n\n- ✅ Install [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- ✅ Configure your API key to use the Gemini model\n- ✅ Build your first simple agent\n- ✅ Run your agent and watch it use a tool (like Google Search) to answer a question\n\n## ‼️ Please Read\n\n> ❌ **ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n> This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only. You **do not** need to submit it anywhere to complete the course.\n\n> ⏸️ **Note:**  When you first start the notebook via running a cell you might see a banner in the notebook header that reads **\"Waiting for the next available notebook\"**. The queue should drop rapidly; however, during peak bursts you might have to wait a few minutes.\n\n> ❌ **Note:** Avoid using the **Run all** cells command as this can trigger a QPM limit resulting in 429 errors when calling the backing model. Suggested flow is to run each cell in order - one at a time. [See FAQ on 429 errors for more information.](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaggle5daysofai/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs)\n\n**For help: Ask questions on the [Kaggle Discord](https://discord.com/invite/kaggle) server.**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 📖 Get started with Kaggle Notebooks\n\nIf this is your first time using Kaggle Notebooks, welcome!

The Soviet Union and its allies employed extensive security apparatuses, including intelligence agencies like the KGB, to maintain internal control, suppress dissent, and conduct espionage against Western powers. These operations were often justified by the need to protect the communist state from internal and external threats, including perceived \"international communist conspiracies\".\n\nConversely, Western nations, particularly the United States, developed robust security operations to counter the spread of communism. This included the establishment of national security doctrines, counterinsurgency training, and intelligence gathering focused on communist movements and states. The \"securitization\" of ideologies, where an ideology is framed as an existential threat, became a key feature of this period, with communism often being equated with terrorism in security discourse.\n\nTheoretically, communist ideology itself has been linked to specific approaches to security. Some interpretations suggest that communist theory can rationalize and cover preparations for violence and aggressive action by imputing aggressive intentions to perceived enemies. This could lead to a security posture characterized by suspicion, preemptive action, and a focus on ideological purity.\n\nFurthermore, the concept of national security within communist states was often framed by Marxist-Leninist ideology, which viewed the external world as inherently hostile and emphasized the need for a strong state apparatus to protect the revolution.

This correlation primarily stems from the emphasis on state control, ideology, and the perceived need to protect the communist system from internal and external threats.\n\nHere are several ways in which security operations and communism are intertwined:\n\n*   **State Surveillance and Control:** Communist regimes, by their nature, often prioritize a strong state apparatus to maintain power and enforce ideology. This translates into extensive surveillance operations, aiming to monitor citizens, suppress dissent, and identify potential \"enemies of the state.\" The existence of secret police forces and intelligence agencies was a hallmark of many communist states, directly linked to internal security operations. For instance, the Soviet Union utilized various intelligence agencies like the GRU, OGPU, NKVD, and KGB for espionage and internal security.\n*   **Ideological Security:** In communist systems, ideology is paramount and is considered an integral component of national security. Security operations are often geared towards protecting this ideology from \"corrupting\" external influences and internal deviations. This can involve censorship, propaganda, and the suppression of ideas deemed counter-revolutionary. The term \"ideological security\" itself suggests a security apparatus focused on safeguarding the communist party's doctrines and rule.\n*   **Suppression of Dissent and Opposition:** Communist parties, in their pursuit of a classless society, often view any form of opposition as a threat to their revolution and the state. Security operations, therefore, are crucial for identifying, neutralizing, and often persecuting political dissidents, \"saboteurs,\" and \"foreign agents\". This can range from intelligence gathering and surveillance to more overt actions like arrests, imprisonment, and even violence.\n*   **\"Active Measures\" and Espionage:** Communist states, particularly the Soviet Union, employed \"active measures\" as a form of political warfare. These encompassed a wide range of operations, including propaganda, disinformation, and even terrorist acts, all aimed at advancing communist interests and undermining adversaries. Espionage activities, such as the transmission of confidential information (like atomic bomb secrets), were also a significant component of these security operations.\n*   **Cold War Context:** The Cold War epitomized the security operations associated with communism. The ideological struggle between communist and capitalist blocs led to massive investments in intelligence, counter-intelligence, and military operations. Both sides engaged in covert operations, espionage, and proxy conflicts, with communist states like the Soviet Union actively intervening to maintain communist rule in Eastern Europe and elsewhere.\n*   **Terrorism and Insurgency:** In some instances, communist groups have engaged in terrorism and guerrilla warfare to achieve their political objectives, often with state backing. This further blurs the lines between security operations and acts of political violence conducted in the name of communism.\n\nIn essence, the security operations within communist states were not merely about traditional defense but were deeply embedded in the ideology and political system, serving to preserve the party's power, enforce ideological conformity, and combat perceived threats to the communist order","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"You can see a summary of ADK and its available languages in the response.\n\n### 2.4 How does it work?\n\nThe agent performed a Google Search to get the latest information about ADK, and it knew to use this tool because:\n\n1.
