Now, you'll learn how to scale up by building **agent teams**.\n\nJust like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll:\n\n- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n\n**ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n\nThis notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only. You **do not** need to submit it anywhere to complete the course.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 📖 Get started with Kaggle Notebooks\n\nIf this is your first time using Kaggle Notebooks, welcome!

Security systems are also increasingly being utilized as sources of business intelligence.\n\nThis evolving landscape is driving a paradigm shift from traditional Security Analyst roles to specialized AI security positions. Key new roles include:\n\n*   **AI Security Architect:** Responsible for establishing governance structures, policies, and risk management for AI deployments, ensuring compliance with regulations and ethical standards, and guiding the secure design of AI platforms.\n*   **AI Security Engineer:** Focuses on the practical implementation and testing of security solutions within AI environments. This involves safeguarding data pipelines, training environments, ensuring model integrity, developing tools to counter adversarial attacks, and conducting penetration testing against AI systems.\n*   **AI Threat Modeler:** Specializes in identifying and analyzing threats specific to AI systems. This role involves mapping attack surfaces and developing mitigation strategies for vulnerabilities unique to AI, such as model drift and adversarial attacks.\n\nIn essence, AI is automating many routine tasks previously handled by human analysts. However, this is not leading to a complete replacement of analysts but rather a transformation of their roles.

This can be unreliable. A complex LLM might decide to skip a step, run them in the wrong order, or get \"stuck,\" making the process unpredictable.\n\n**The Solution: A Fixed Pipeline**\n\nWhen you need tasks to happen in a **guaranteed, specific order**, you can use a `SequentialAgent`. This agent acts like an assembly line, running each sub-agent in the exact order you list them.

The `SequentialAgent` and `ParallelAgent` produce their final output and then stop. This 'one-shot' approach isn't good for tasks that require refinement and quality control. What if the first draft of our story is bad? We have no way to review it and ask for a rewrite.\n\n**The Solution: Iterative Refinement**\n\nWhen a task needs to be improved through cycles of feedback and revision, you can use a `LoopAgent`. A `LoopAgent` runs a set of sub-agents repeatedly *until a specific condition is met or a maximum number of iterations is reached.* This creates a refinement cycle, allowing the agent system to improve its own work over and over.\n\n**Use Loop when:** Iterative improvement is needed, quality refinement matters, or you need repeated cycles.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [loop agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Story Writing & Critique Loop**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[\"Initial Prompt\"] -- > B[\"Writer Agent\"]\n    B -- >|story| C[\"Critic Agent\"]\n    C -- >|critique| D{\"Iteration < Max<br>AND<br>Not Approved?\"}\n    D -- >|Yes| B\n    D -- >|No| E[\"Final Story\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ccffcc\n    style C fill:#ffcccc\n    style D fill:#ffffcc\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"250\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/loop-agent.png\" alt=\"Loop Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 5.1 Example: Iterative Story Refinement\n\nLet's build a system with two agents:\n\n1. **Writer Agent** - Writes a draft of a short story\n2. **Critic Agent** - Reviews and critiques the short story to suggest improvements","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent runs ONCE at the beginning to create the first draft.\ninitial_writer_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"InitialWriterAgent\",\n    model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n    instruction=\"\"\"Based on the user's prompt, write the first draft of a short story (around 100-150 words).\n    Output only the story text, with no introduction or explanation.\"\"\",\n    output_key=\"current_story\", # Stores the first draft in the state.\n)\n\nprint(\"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\")","metadata":{"id":"a2b8WlJoBtHF","outputId":"13ed1e15-dcf9-4e1d-ad1e-fb18ee793de5","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-16T16:06:52.035063Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-16T16:06:52.035414Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-16T16:06:52.041173Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-16T16:06:52.035391Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-16T16:06:52.040144Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":18},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent's only job is to provide feedback or the approval signal.

Here's a breakdown of its strengths and areas for improvement:\n\n**Plot:** The plot is straightforward and serves its purpose well. It establishes a relatable problem (alert fatigue) and presents a logical resolution (AI integration). The cause-and-effect is clear and satisfying.\n\n**Characters:** Kai is a relatable protagonist for anyone who has experienced a demanding, repetitive job. His feelings of burnout are palpable. However, he remains a bit of a one-dimensional character, existing primarily to embody the problem. The AI is also a functional element rather than a character.\n\n**Pacing:** The pacing is generally good. The first paragraph effectively conveys the overwhelming nature of Kai's day. The transition to the AI solution is swift, which works for a short piece, but could be expanded.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Show, Don't Just Tell the Impact:** While the story *tells* us Kai's eyes burned and his mind felt like static, it could be more impactful by *showing* this through a brief anecdote. For example, a moment where he almost misses something important due to his fatigue, or a specific instance of him dismissing a potentially real alert out of habit. This would heighten the stakes before the AI solution is introduced.\n2.  **Flesh out the AI's Integration:** The transition to the AI is very abrupt (\"Later that week...\"). Adding a sentence or two about the *process* of integration or Kai's initial skepticism or hope towards the new platform could make the solution feel more earned and less like a magic fix. This would also give Kai a more active role in the resolution beyond just experiencing it.\n3.  **Illustrate the AI's Effectiveness:** Instead of stating the AI flagged anomalies Kai would have missed, briefly describe *one* such anomaly and how it was different from the usual noise. This would make the AI's contribution more concrete and impressive. For example, \"It flagged a peculiar string of outbound traffic that, while not matching any known signature, deviated drastically from baseline behavior – an anomaly Kai, conditioned by years of false alarms, would have likely overlooked.\"\nRefinerAgent > The glowing monitors were a constant hum, a symphony of red and yellow alerts that Kai had learned to tune out. Another day, another deluge of false positives from the SIEM. His eyes burned, his mind felt like static. He’d clicked through hundreds of notifications before lunch, each one a tiny prick of anxiety that never bloomed into anything real. Just yesterday, he’d nearly dismissed a critical alert as another phantom when a sudden, jarring spike in system resources caught his eye – a ghost in the machine he’d almost missed. The truly critical alerts, he feared, were lost in the noise, invisible until it was too late. He slumped back, the weight of it all crushing.\n\nThe following Monday, the team began integrating a new AI-powered threat intelligence platform. Kai was initially skeptical, having seen promising new tools fizzle out before. But as the AI ingested historical data, it began to meticulously learn Kai’s established patterns and identify the usual sources of false positives. It wasn't instantaneous, but within days, the deafening deluge of alerts slowed to a manageable trickle of high-fidelity, actionable incidents. The AI didn't just filter; it learned to recognize the subtle. It flagged a peculiar string of outbound traffic that, while not matching any known signature, deviated drastically from baseline behavior – an anomaly Kai, conditioned by years of false alarms, would have likely overlooked. The AI presented it not as a deafening alarm, but as a quiet, intelligent whisper. For the first time in months, Kai could finally breathe, his focus sharp and his energy restored, ready to tackle the threats that actually mattered.\nCriticAgent > The story is well-written and complete. It effectively portrays the problem of alert fatigue for a SOC analyst and presents a believable and satisfying AI-driven solution.

For instance, describe him rubbing his temples, the way his focus drifts, or a brief, cynical internal thought about the futility of his job before the AI intervenes. This would make his eventual re-engagement with the critical alert more dramatic.\n\n2.  **Flesh Out the \"Subtle Anomaly\":** The transition from \"noise\" to a \"subtle anomaly\" is a crucial pivot. You could slightly expand on what made this anomaly different. Was it a unique combination of events? A timing issue? Even a brief descriptive phrase about the *nature* of the anomaly could heighten the suspense and make Elias's pause more significant.\n\n3.  **Strengthen the AI's Impact:** The AI’s effectiveness is the story’s payoff. While the summary it provides is good, consider adding a brief sentence about *how* it arrived at that conclusion, or what Elias *would have had to do* manually to discover it. This would emphasize the AI's value beyond just filtering, showcasing its analytical capabilities and making Elias's relief more profound. For example, \"The AI had not only filtered the noise but correlated seemingly unrelated events, a process that would have taken Elias hours of manual analysis.\"\nRefinerAgent > The blinking red lights on Elias’s dashboard were a familiar, nauseating hum.

He sighed, reaching for his coffee, the lukewarm liquid doing little to cut through his weariness.\n\nHe remembered a new AI tool they'd piloted. It was supposed to learn his patterns, filter the noise, and flag genuine threats. He’d been skeptical, another piece of software promising miracles. But desperation gnawed at him. He activated it. Within minutes, the cascade of alerts thinned, the obnoxious red lights softening to a more manageable amber. A single, high-priority notification remained, accompanied by a concise, almost eerily calm summary: \"Suspicious outbound traffic, potential data exfiltration attempt. Originating from workstation X, user Y. Correlation suggests a novel exploit targeting legacy systems.\" Elias leaned forward, the fatigue momentarily forgotten, replaced by a jolt of adrenaline. The AI had not only filtered the noise but correlated seemingly unrelated events, a process that would have taken him hours of painstaking manual analysis. It had found the needle in the haystack, and in doing so, had breathed life back into his flagging vigilance.\nCriticAgent > APPROVED","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"You've now implemented a loop agent, creating a sophisticated system that can iteratively review and improve its own output.

You're Now an Agent Orchestrator\n\nIn this notebook, you made the leap from a single agent to a **multi-agent system**.\n\nYou saw **why** a team of specialists is easier to build and debug than one \"do-it-all\" agent. Most importantly, you learned how to be the **director** of that team.\n\nYou used `SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, and `LoopAgent` to create deterministic workflows, and you even used an LLM as a 'manager' to make dynamic decisions. You also mastered the \"plumbing\" by using `output_key` to pass state between agents and make them collaborative.\n\n**ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n\nThis notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only. You **do not** need to submit it anywhere to complete the course.\n\n### 📚 Learn More\n\nRefer to the following documentation to learn more:\n\n- [Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/)\n- [Sequential Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/sequential-agents/)\n- [Parallel Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/parallel-agents/)\n- [Loop Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/)\n- [Custom Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/custom-agents/)\n\n### 🎯 Next Steps\n\nReady for the next challenge?
